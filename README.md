Omnidroid is an open-source Libretro frontend for Android, forked from [Lemuroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid).

It keeps the core that made Lemuroid solid — ROM scanning, strong Android integration, and a wide set of cores — and builds on top of it with a landscape-first launcher, full controller navigation, richer cloud saves, native Vulkan hardware acceleration, and extensive improvements to UI, functionality, and performance. All while keeping the release build lightweight (universal release APK under 10 MB, ~16% smaller than Lemuroid's baseline).

It started as a fork of Lemuroid (itself a descendant of [Retrograde](https://github.com/retrograde/retrograde-android)). Omnidroid elevates the emulation stack with its custom-engineered [omni-libretrodroid](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abousaif/omni-libretrodroid) native engine—introducing native Vulkan hardware acceleration, 16KB memory page alignment, low-latency audio, and adaptive dual-screen rendering.

## Newly added features

### Vulkan Hardware Acceleration & Graphics API Selection

- **Vulkan Rendering Engine:** Powered by our custom `omni-libretrodroid` engine, offering modern Vulkan hardware acceleration alongside OpenGL ES 2/3 and Software rendering pipelines.
- **Graphics API Selector:** Choose between **Auto**, **Vulkan**, **OpenGL**, and **Software** per console system or globally in Settings.
- **Peak Performance:** Delivers rock-solid 60 FPS hardware rendering with low draw-call overhead on supported cores (such as Azahar / Citra 3DS, PPSSPP, Beetle PSX HW, and Dolphin).

### A real game launcher

- Browse your whole library in landscape, like a handheld instead of a settings app.
- Jump between **All games**, **Favorites**, and each console from a sidebar.
- Set Omnidroid as your Android home screen.
- See battery, Wi-Fi or mobile data, and whether a controller is connected, without leaving the App.

### A library that is easier to live in

- Zoom game covers in or out to show more or fewer games.
- The library grid picks how many rows to show from the **available screen height**, so phones, tall devices, and tablets stay readable at every zoom level.
- Hit **Continue** to jump straight back into your last game.
- Search as you type, advanced search for all games and consoles.

### Play with a controller, not just in-game

- Plug in a gamepad and move through the whole app: library, search, consoles, settings, and game pages.
- See what each button does on a hint bar at the bottom.
- Highlighted items glow so you always know what you are about to select.

### Game pages

- Open a game to see its cover, description, genre, release date, publisher, rating, play time, and when you last played it.
- When RAWG metadata is enabled and a trailer is available, play it from the cover.
- Favorite a game, play it, or change that game’s settings from the same screen.
- Set a custom game image for any title.
- Give any game a custom name.
- Pick a per-game fast-forward speed, including 8x and 16x.

### Experimental RAWG game metadata

- Under **Settings → Advanced**, turn on **RAWG game metadata** (off by default).
- Enter your own free API key from [rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs); the key field appears under the toggle.
- On the next library sync, Omnidroid searches RAWG by title, caches description, genres, release date, publisher, rating, and backdrop image on device, and keeps Libretro box art for covers unless a portrait screenshot is available.
- Trailers come from RAWG’s movie files when present — no YouTube scraping.
- Independent of cloud login / save sync; leave it off and game pages show empty metadata fields.

### Add consoles

- Flip through consoles and install the ones you want, with touch or a controller.

### Revamped settings

- Landscape settings with a sidebar for Library, Display, Controllers, Saves, Advanced, and About.
- Big cards on the settings home so you can jump straight to what you need.
- Same look as the rest of the app, and fully usable with a controller.
- About covers privacy policy, donation channels, and developer info.

### Cast to a TV

- Send games to a TV or monitor over Cast, wireless display, or HDMI.
- Pick a game on your phone; it appears on the big screen.

### Cloud saves (Play build)

- Sync saves with **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, or **OneDrive**.
- Pull down the latest save before a game starts, or play anyway if you do not want to wait.
- Turn cloud save on or off for a single game.
- Pick how often auto-sync runs.
- Resolve conflicts when local and cloud saves disagree.
- Export or import a backup zip of your saves.

### Smarter HD mode

- HD mode turns itself off when the battery drops below 15%, then comes back when you have charge again.

### Touch D-Pad: 4-way or 8-way

- In **Edit Controls**, toggle **8-way D-Pad** on or off for any console with a D-Pad.
- On = diagonals (default); off = cardinal directions only.
- Saved per layout and orientation with your other touch control settings.

### NDS and 3DS dual-screen layouts & quick controls

- **melonDS DS (NDS):** Screens layout includes **Top Only** and **Bottom Only**, alongside Top–Bottom and Left–Right.
- **Azahar / Citra (3DS):** Screens layout includes **Default Top-Bottom**, **Side by Side**, and **Single Screen** (with Top/Bottom selection), switchable via in-game settings or the touch overlay toggle button.
- **Interactive 3DS Touchscreen Overlay:** Accurate touch stylus input mapped to the 3DS bottom screen with precise aspect-ratio coordinate conversion.
- **Quick Screen Toggle:** On the virtual pad (melonDS DS / Azahar / Citra), tap the **screen layout** button to toggle dual ↔ **Top only** without opening the menu. The core option stays perfectly synchronized with in-game settings.

### Vibration intensity

- Under **Settings → Controllers** (and Advanced → Input), a **Vibration intensity** slider (0–100, default 50) controls strength for both touch feedback and rumble.
- Applies to on-screen control haptics and gamepad / device rumble together.

### NDS and 3DS touchscreen with virtual buttons

- You can use the emulated touchscreen while holding on-screen buttons — a second finger on the game screen still registers as the stylus.
- Tap the **hide pads** button on the DS/3DS virtual pad to slide the controls away and give the game more screen space (handy for stylus-only moments). A small edge tab at the bottom brings the pads back.

### Your profile

- Open **Profile** from the library top bar. A gamer tag and robot avatar are created on first launch; change either anytime.
- Earn XP from play sessions (~1 XP per minute), with a daily streak bonus that scales up to ×1.7 for consecutive days.
- Level up on a smooth curve from total XP; see current level, progress to the next, and total playtime.
- Track current and best play streaks (counted at local midnight).
- Unlock consoles as you install them or scan games, and earn collection badges (Collector → Enthusiast → Historian → Omnidroid Master).
- Browse recent sessions with XP earned per session.
- When cloud saves are enabled, your profile syncs as `profile.json` alongside game saves.

### Device profile and benchmarking

- Under **Settings → Advanced → Device profile**, see manufacturer, SoC, RAM, CPU cores and frequencies, GPU / OpenGL ES, and Vulkan support.
- A quiet quick CPU baseline (~0.5s) runs the first time you open the app.
- Optionally run a 30-second CPU benchmark (welcome prompt on first launch, or re-run anytime from Device profile) to measure throughput in ops/s and help gauge how well the device can run emulators.

## Description

Omnidroid is built to feel like a dedicated handheld, not a settings-heavy emulator. Scan a folder of ROMs, pick a game, play. When a controller is connected, the whole UI is navigable without touching the screen. When a TV is connected, games can launch on that display.

The original Lemuroid goals still apply: ease of use, good Android integration, and a great emulation experience. Omnidroid just takes those further.

- **Shaders & State Management:** Supports quick save/load states and CRT / modern display enhancement shaders.

## Features from Lemuroid, still here

- Android TV support
- Automatically save and restore game states
- ROM scanning and indexing
- Quick save/load
- Support for zipped ROMs
- Display simulation (LCD/CRT)
- Gamepad support
- Local multiplayer
- Tilt input
- Customizable touch controls (size, position, and 4-way / 8-way D-Pad)
- HD mode

## Bug fixes

These are issues from Lemuroid’s original flow, or regressions found while building Omnidroid, that are now fixed:

- Tapping a library game no longer launches it by accident. Only **Continue** starts play immediately.
- System status and navigation bars leaked over the launcher; both are hidden.
- HD mode could keep burning battery at low charge. It now auto-disables under 15%.
- Core updates re-downloaded cores that were already on disk. Missing cores are detected and fetched instead.
- Play-flavor core load errors pointed people at the Play Store even when that was not the problem.
- Cloud sync could wipe a newer local save when a remote file disappeared. Deletes are no longer propagated.
- Simultaneous local and cloud changes had no resolution UI. Conflicts can now be kept, replaced, or duplicated.
- There was no way to back up saves without a cloud account. Export/import zip covers that.

## Languages

You can help translate the original Lemuroid strings here: https://crowdin.com/project/lemuroid

Omnidroid-specific strings (library, cast, cloud providers, controller hints, game details) are currently English-first.
